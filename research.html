<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>We propose a three-stage training strategy called dual pseudo training (DPT) for conditional image generation and classification in semi-supervised learning. First, a classifier is trained on partially labeled data and predicts pseudo labels for all data. Second, a conditional generative model is trained on all data with pseudo labels and generates pseudo images given labels. Finally, the classifier is trained on real data augmented by pseudo images with labels. We demonstrate large-scale diffusion models and semi-supervised learners benefit mutually with a few labels via DPT. In particular, on the ImageNet 256x256 generation benchmark, DPT can generate realistic, diverse, and semantically correct images with very few labels. With two (i.e., < 0.2%) and five (i.e., < 0.4%) labels per class, DPT achieves an FID of 3.44 and 3.37 respectively, outperforming strong diffusion models with full labels, such as IDDPM, CDM, ADM, and LDM. Besides, DPT outperforms competitive semi-supervised baselines substantially on ImageNet classification benchmarks with one, two, and five labels per class, achieving state-of-the-art top-1 accuracies of 59.0 (+2.8), 69.5 (+3.0), and 73.6 (+1.2) respectively.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Banks differ from non-financial firms as they must communicate to both regulators and shareholders. Also, unlike non-financial firms, banks possess opaque and complex balance sheets and are the main providers of credit to the real economy. In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the idiosyncratic uncertainty banks face at the bank-quarter level by applying natural language processing techniques to earnings conference call transcripts. The index reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending the next quarter and higher liquidity, suggesting active management of uncertainty. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of high aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin-in-the-game. Using loan-level data and firm-fixed effects, I control for demand-side factors and find higher bank-level uncertainty is associated with lower loan issuances the following quarter.</p>
